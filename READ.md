Hi there! 😊 Welcome to My GitHub!
I'm Bhanu Sri Tanneru, a dedicated DevOps Engineer passionate about creating seamless, automated workflows that support scalable, reliable infrastructure. I believe in continuous improvement and aim to build solutions that are not only efficient but also innovative.

About Me
Currently based in Prague, Czech Republic, I specialize in CI/CD pipeline development, infrastructure automation, and cloud architecture. With hands-on experience in tools like Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, and Jenkins, I thrive in designing systems that are both resilient and adaptable. My journey in DevOps started after gaining a strong foundation as a Data Analyst, where I developed skills in data modeling, data warehousing, and business intelligence.

🌱 My DevOps Philosophy
🚀 Continuous Innovation: DevOps is all about building, experimenting, and refining systems. I believe in using every iteration as a chance to innovate and push boundaries.
🔍 Automation as a Mindset: Automating repetitive tasks frees up creativity and time for more strategic work. I’m always on the lookout for ways to make workflows simpler and faster.
🛠️ Resilience through Adaptation: Just as systems need to be adaptable to new changes, I strive to keep learning and evolving with each new challenge, adapting my approach to meet the project’s needs.
🤝 Collaboration is Key: A DevOps pipeline only succeeds when the team is in sync. Collaboration and shared goals drive every project, enabling smoother and faster deployments.

🌟 Key Skills
CI/CD Pipeline Development: Automated build, testing, and deployment processes to speed up release cycles.
Infrastructure Automation: Leveraged Terraform and Ansible to ensure consistent infrastructure across environments.
Containerization & Orchestration: Built containerized applications with Docker, orchestrated using Kubernetes.
Monitoring & Alerting: Configured monitoring solutions for proactive system health tracking.

📂 Projects & Contributions
Here are some hands-on projects I’m proud of:
